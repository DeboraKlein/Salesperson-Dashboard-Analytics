# Salesperson-Dashboard-Analytics  
An Excel-based dashboard for analyzing salesperson performance. Uses dynamic images and pivot tables to provide interactive insights into sales trends and individual achievements.  

## Overview  
This repository showcases my expertise in creating dynamic and interactive Excel dashboards for salesperson performance analysis. I continuously update and improve it as I refine my skills, ensuring the best possible insights and functionality.  

The dashboards were created using Excel and leverage interactive visuals and pivot tables to present the analysis effectively. The dynamic images are built using the Excel functions INDEX/MATCH, ensuring interactive and adaptable visuals.  

Additionally, Excel handles databases efficiently up to approximately **5 MB**. If the dataset exceeds this size, it is recommended to use other tools, such as **Power BI**, for better performance and scalability.  

## Features  
- Track individual sales performance.  
- Compare sales trends across periods.  
- Highlight top performers.  
- Interactive visuals created with dynamic images and pivot tables.  

## Portfolio Presentation  
This repository is part of my **professional portfolio**, demonstrating my ability to build Excel-based dashboards for performance analysis. The files included showcase interactive designs and effective data visualization techniques.  

Below are sample previews of the dashboards:

## Dashboard Development Process  

### **1. Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
Before analyzing data, it's essential to determine which **KPIs** will provide valuable insights. This dashboard includes:  
- **Revenue-Based Metrics** (Monthly Sales in currency)  
- **Quantity-Based Metrics** (Number of units sold per month)  
- **Individual Performance Metrics** (Sales per salesperson, ranking, trends)  

### **2. Structuring the Dataset**  
To ensure smooth analysis, the dataset was adjusted:  
- **New columns** for Month, Day, Year were created to facilitate time-based comparisons.  
- **Irrelevant columns** were removed to keep the dataset optimized for analysis.  

### **3. Pivot Table Analysis & Slicers**  
Pivot Tables were implemented to dynamically analyze sales trends:  
- Organized data into **pivot tables** for easy aggregation.  
- Added **Slicers** for efficient filtering.  
- Connected all pivot tables to the same slicers to allow seamless filtering across the dashboard.  

### **4. Editing Images & Photos**  
- Images were selected from **free picks**, with names created only for dashboard purposes (not real individuals).  
- Adjusted images for consistency in dashboard design.  

### **5. Creating Dynamic Image Tables**  
To display **top sellers or rankings** dynamically:  
- Built an **image table** linking salesperson photos.  
- Used **INDEX/MATCH** for locating images efficiently (better than VLOOKUP for image handling).  

### **6. Designing the Dashboard Layout**  
- Structured a **clean and professional layout** ensuring clarity and usability.  
- Added background elements and charts to enhance readability.  

### **7. Customization Options**  
The **third dashboard** includes two visualization options:  
- **Light Mode:** A standard design with clear contrasts and easy-to-read data.  
- **Dark Mode:** A visually comfortable alternative that reduces eye strain, especially for prolonged use.  

Users can switch between these modes for better accessibility and convenience.  

### **8. Final Integration**  
- Combined all elements into a **functional dashboard**.  
- Tested usability with filters and interactive visuals.  

## How to Use  
1. Download the Excel file from this repository.  
2. Open the file in Excel.  
3. Use the filters and interactive charts to analyze the data.  

## Usage  
- Navigate to the dashboard folder.  
- Open the desired dashboard file to view performance metrics.
